# Exe3

This class serves as a simple intermediary, connecting and simplifying the interaction between the 2D map implementation and the Map2D interface.
Designed for the course, it uses static methods to enable a "Singleton-like" implementation. 
The goal of this project is to provide various functions for managing and manipulating a 2D map, such as adding, removing, and accessing elements within the map. 
This class serves as a foundational step towards building more complex map handling systems, allowing you to perform operations efficiently in a two-dimensional space.
